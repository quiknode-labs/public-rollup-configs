# QuickNode Public Rollup Configurations

This repository stores configuration files for the various rollups deployed by QuickNode. Each rollup is associated with a unique `chainId` and its corresponding `rollup.json` configuration file. These files contain essential settings and parameters for the proper operation of the rollup networks.

## Folder Structure

The repository follows a simple folder structure where each folder is named by the `chainId` of the respective rollup. Inside each folder, you'll find configuration files like `rollup.json` and potentially other important configurations.
